# 3D-Graph
3D graph rendered that allows fps like movement

The program has a perspective projection system coded using vectors and 3D space. Currently it allows you to paint any pixel in 3D space and then visualize it based on the location of your camera. 

There are some drawbacks such as no color support and very slow processing. Note that there is not use of this project except as a way to get familiarity with cameras, rendering, matrices and projection at the moment.
In the future however there are plans to introduce massive speed ups making it a practical low-weight rendering library. 

## Compiling

No external libraries are needed. Currently windows only but work is being done on making it cross-platform. 

Use VS 2017 or later and you can compile with no extra steps. However, retarget for Windows SDK version if mismatch.
